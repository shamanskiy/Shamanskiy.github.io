Not so long ago, I've decided to dip my toe in computer graphics. As many of us, I encounter it indirectly pretty much everywhere - games, 3D modeling apps, Hollywood blockbusters to name a few - so you could say that I have a lot of experience with computer graphics. But I wanted to look under the hood, I wanted to follow the way of a triangle as it turns from numbers in a file to a beautifully lit 3D model on my screen. I knew that OpenGL was somehow involved, so I've started to learn it. Below is a brief description of my progress so far.

First steps 
---------
For all wannabee
Initial setup
COde for the first window

Conclusion

Brutally simple, you have to everything, cool to realize how everything is math.
