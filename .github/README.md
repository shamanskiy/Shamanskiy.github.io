# CodeThatMath
This is my personal blog about mathematics, programming and some other stuff like lifestyle,
languages and music, but mainly about mathematics and programming. 

The blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), uses this awesome [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/) theme
and is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) on [https://www.codethatmath.com](https://www.codethatmath.com). 
In case you think that this is cool, [here](https://devblast.com/b/create-a-static-websiteblog-with-jekyll-and-github-pages) 
is a blog post that explains how you can create your own blog using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. 

## How to host locally
To host this blog locally, you will need the following:
1. [Install](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) Ruby
2. Install Bundler:
